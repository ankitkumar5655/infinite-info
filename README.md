infinite-info : The project allows the users to search through much content that not only gives information about what you want to know but also provides a unique platform where you can buy or sell the products directly to the consumers. I am still working on this project, along with the newer version that will be published in February 2025, which will be bundled with some extra features of utilities, and the scrolling experience will be a piece of cake. This project is created using HTML, CSS, and new frameworks of CSS and Core Javascript. Stay tuned with me for new releases. Many of the options are not working, which will be fixed. I hope you will support and like this project.Â
